AbstractWhile behavior learning has made impressive progress in recent times, it lags behind computer vision and natural language processing due to its inability to leverage large, human-generated datasets. Human behaviors have wide variance, multiple modes, and human demonstrations typically do not come with reward labels. These properties limit the applicability of current methods in Offline RL and Behavioral Cloning to learn from large, pre-collected datasets. In this work, we present Behavior Transformer (BeT), a new technique to model unlabeled demonstration data with multiple modes. BeT retrofits standard transformer architectures with action discretization coupled with a multi-task action correction inspired by offset prediction in object detection. 摘要在 Marp 中使用 Markdown 内容定义自定义样式的 footer 可能有点复杂，因为 Marp 的 CSS 用于装饰性目的，并不直接支持嵌入 Markdown。但是，你还可以通过一些技巧来实现这一要求。一个可行的方法是，在 Markdown 文件中直接包含 HTML，并使用 CSS 来调整样式。你可以在 Markdown 中直接使用 HTML 标签，然后通过在 CSS 中定义样式来达到预期的效果。下面是一个示例，说明如何实现包含 Markdown 引用的 footer：创建自定义样式 CSS：首先，在你的 Marp 幻灯片中定义一个自定义 CSS。你可以在 Markdown 文件顶部使用 Front Matter 来指定 CSS 文件路径：","link":"/2024/12/02/paper/"}],"tags":[{"name":"abc","slug":"abc","link":"/tags/abc/"}],"categories":[],"pages":[]}
